  utter_socio_emotional_dev:
  - text: "Engagement with the child even if they are sleeping and show your baby your face and talk to them soothingly right from the start."

  utter_child_res:
  - text: "Newborn don't understand what is happening to them, they don't know who is feeding them, or who helps them when they cry. Generally they start smiling by five to seven weeks and Laugh out loud by three months."

  utter_crying:
  - text: " Children can cry for many reasons basically when they are hungry, tired, or want to sleep etc. They can't cry 'for attention' or to 'get at' their parents - a newborn is not capable of responding to you with any conscious purpose."

  utter_speech_language:
  - text: "For the newborn, crying is their only means of communication.By seven or eight weeks, they begin to discover their voice and make cooing noises and vowel sounds.The general guideline for babies states that the child should be using at least 3 to 4 words in a sentence, and this development happens between the age of 36 and 47 months."

  utter_hearing_seeing:
  - text: "Newborns can hear, and have been hearing noises from well before they were born. They have immature eye muscles and, while they can see (particularly at close range), they can't organize the visual images into meaningful shapes,light, primary colours, stripes, dots and patterns. Eyes move in unison, most of the time, by six weeks."

  utter_child_movement:
  - text: "From as early as infancy, kids are interested in learning about their own bodies. During the first eight weeks they have no control over their movements and all their physical activity is involuntary or reflex."

  utter_development_problems:
  - text: "All children are different and develop at different rates.However, if your baby is very different from other children, or if you are worried about their development or it seems to go backwards, seek the advice of a health professional."

  utter_baby_sleep:
  - text: "Babies don’t know that the norm is to sleep at night-time and be awake during the day. So they sleep in bursts of three or four hours usually. Within 10–20 minutes, the baby enters the deep sleep stage, when they are particularly difficult to wake up."

  utter_baby_massage:
  - text: "Baby massage has many benefits and is a wonderful way for you to feel close to your baby.Massage can be done for babies of all ages, your baby's legs are a good place to begin the massage followed by arms, chest, back and head."

  utter_baby_bath:
  - text: "Keeping your baby clean in the first few days is pretty basic. Sponge baths are enough to keep a newborn clean while your baby's umbilical cord stump is still hanging on, later you may use a bath tub or seat with moderate water temperature."

  utter_baby_breastfeed:
  - text: "Breast-milk is tailored to the needs of human infants which contains at least 100 ingredients that aren’t found in cow’s milk. Breastfed babies are required to feed every 2-3 hours or likely 7-8 times a day. Most moms feel uncomfortable breastfeeding their baby, Specialists say that this discomfort usually goes away after the first 2-3 weeks."

  utter_post_delivery_recovery:
  - text: "Good nutrition, a bit of gentle exercise as well as plenty of rest are essential. Heating foods are what you need after birth to help your body recover.Getting enough water is also vital, especially if you are breastfeeding."

  utter_post_delivery_diet:
  - text: "New mums are often given specific foods during their confinement of the first 40 days after childbirth. High-calorie foods like full cream milk, butter, ghee, dried fruits, sugar, Oats dalia,Pulses and lentils. They also contain ingredients that are believed to increase breastmilk supply."

  utter_baby_brain_dev:
  - text: "Your baby’s brain is built over time: It starts during pregnancy, and continues through to early adulthood. Talking, reading and singing to your baby are all fun and easy ways to help their brain grow also breastfeeding appears to slightly increase a child’s IQ, at least through age 15."

  utter_child_play:
  - text: "Play is a way for your child to familiarize themselves with the world while exploring and testing their own limits. Tummy Time play is the period during the day your baby spends awake and on their stomach. It is a crucial exercise for baby’s motor, visual, and sensory development."

  utter_breastfeeding_or_formula_qty:
  - text: "Remember—there are no absolutes when it comes to how much formula or breast milk to feed your little one at each meal. A very rough general rule of thumb is to take your baby’s weight and multiply it by 2.5—that’s the total number of ounces to feed your baby over the course of a 24-hour period."

  utter_baby_smile:
  - text: "Cheer up . . . and smile. Even some of the happiest babies don’t start true social smiling until 6 or 7 weeks of age. And once they start smiling, some are just naturally more smiley than others. Many babies laugh out loud for the first time when they're 3 or 4 months old."

  utter_child_swaddle:
  - text: "Research shows that infants who are swaddled before they’re put on their backs cry less— and sleep better. Wrapped into a tight little bundle, they’re also less likely to startle and be woken up by those normal, jerky movements. But don’t swaddle once your baby is active enough to kick off the swaddling blanket."

  utter_child_crawl_walk:
  - text: "The age babies begin to crawl varies considerably, and depends on the child and the environment, however generally babies will start to crawl anywhere from 6 – 10 months of age and should crawl and creep for approximately 3 – 4 months or more, not less! While they typically start walking around their first birthday (12-15 months is the expected time when walking happens)."

  utter_bottle_sterilize:
  - text: "It's important to sterilise all your baby's feeding equipment, including bottles and teats, until they are at least 12 months old. This will protect your baby against infections, in particular diarrhoea and vomiting."

  utter_preparation_for_workig_mom:
  - text: "There’s plenty of prep work to be done before your nursing and pumping plan is ready to roll out.
          Start off slow- if you’re going back to a full-time job, begin with a short week which will also be a little less overwhelming than starting out with 5 days ahead of you.
          Bring on the bottle- if you haven’t already, get busy with the bottle even if you won’t be heading back to work for a while
          Get pumping- begin pumping a few weeks before you’re due back at the office. That way, not only will you be a more confident pumper, but also you’ll have started collecting a stash of frozen milk by the time you start collecting paychecks."

  utter_return_work_postpreg:
  - text: "Work part-time. If you can swing a part time schedule, at least at first, you’ll be able to spend more time strengthening breastfeeding links.
           Working 4 or 5 half days is more practical than 2 or 3 full ones for several reasons. With half days, you may not have to miss any feedings and certainly no more than one a day. 
           You’ll have little trouble with leakage (your clothes will thank you), and probably won’t have to do any on the-job pumping (which means you’ll  actually get to drink coffee on your coffee break). 
           Best of all, you’ll spend most of each day with your baby. Working nights is another option that interferes very little with breastfeeding, especially once baby is sleeping through the night, but it can seriously interfere with two other very important commodities: rest and romance."

  utter_workplace_feeding:
  - text: "Once you’re back on the job, finding the time and the place to pump can be a bit of a challenge, depending on your workplace. The logistics will be easier if you work in a large company that is required by law to accommodate working breastfeeding moms or at a smaller company that’s enlightened enough to do this voluntarily.
           Wear clothes that are convenient for pumping, or even designed for breastfeeding moms. Be sure your work tops can be lifted or opened easily for pumping at work, and that they won’t be stretched out of shape or wrinkled by being pulled up or open. Whatever you wear, line your nursing bra with breast pads to protect your clothing, And carry an extra supply of pads in your bag to replace wet ones."

  utter_pumping_privacy:
  - text: "If you’re able to pump behind the closed door of your office, awesome. Privacy problem solved. If not, look for an unused office or conference room, or a clean corner in the bathroom lounge. Keep in mind that if you’re employed in a large company, the law’s on your side when it comes to providing an appropriate place for pumping."

  utter_pumping_schedule:
  - text: "Be consistent. Schedule permitting, try to pump at the same times every day as close as possible to the times you would be feeding your baby if you were home. That way your breasts will come to anticipate pumping (as they would anticipate nursing) and fill up with milk like clock work."

  utter_breastfeeding_qty:
  - text: "Expect to nurse your little suckler around 8 to 10 times in a 24-hour period, though some babies may be nursing more often, and that’s perfectly fine. Demand still rules the day—and night. Though you won’t be able to measure the amount going in (unless you’re pumping every meal), your baby will be drinking somewhere between 15 and 32 ounces of breast milk a day."

  utter_formula_feeding_child:
  - text: "For moms who can't breastfeed or who decide not to, infant formula is a healthy alternative. Formula provides babies with the nutrients they need to grow and thrive. Some mothers worry that if they don't breastfeed, they won't bond with their baby. ... The decision to breastfeed or formula feed your baby is a personal one. Your bottle-drinker will likely be taking in around 4 to 6 ounces at every meal. Around 6 a day for a total of 24 to 36 ounces of formula a day."
